# Optimal Path Finder

Welcome to the Optimal Path Finder project! This project utilizes the A* search algorithm to determine the optimal route between two locations. The codebase is written entirely in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Features
- Utilizes the A* search algorithm for efficient route planning.
- Supports finding optimal routes for both walking and driving scenarios.
- Customizable and extendable codebase written in pure Python.

## Usage
To use the Optimal Path Finder:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` file with Python.
3. Follow the prompts to input the starting and ending locations.
4. The program will then calculate and display the optimal route based on your input.

## Example
```
python main.py

Please enter the starting location: Xiamen University Malaysia
Please enter the ending location: [Destination]

Optimal Route:
- [Starting Location] -> [Waypoint 1] -> [Waypoint 2] -> ... -> [Ending Location]
```
